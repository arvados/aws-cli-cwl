aws-s3-bulk-cp.cwl

This is a CWL workflow (with Arvados specific enhancements) to
perform bulk download of a list of S3 objects.

It spreads the load across the desired number of parallel downloads by
splitting up the list and giving each compute node a list of files to
download.

Assumes there are no filename conflicts.

Note: it divides the list up ahead of time, so if there is a big
disparity in object sizes, some jobs might finish before the others.

Files are merged into the final output collection.

Here is what the input.yml file should look like:

# List of s3:// URLs of objects to download
s3urls:
  - s3://bucket1/object1
  - s3://bucket1/object2
  - s3://bucket1/object3

# Number of downloader processes to use
parallel_downloads: 3

# AWS credentials, these are marked as secret inputs
# so they will not be exposed by Arvados
aws_access_key_id:  <access key>
aws_secret_access_key: <secret key>
